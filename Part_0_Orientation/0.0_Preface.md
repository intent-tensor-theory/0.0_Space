# 章零・零（Chapter 0.0）
## Preface — Why Space Must Be Built, Not Assumed

---

**「空は与えられない。許される。」**  
*Space is not given. It is permitted.*

---

### 0.0.1 The Quiet Assumption

Every physical theory carries a silence at its beginning.  
That silence is space.

Sometimes it is explicit: coordinates, metrics, manifolds.  
Sometimes it is denied: "background independence," "relational structure," "no fixed stage."

Yet even when the background is declared absent, something remains:

- a topology in which relations occur,
- a differentiable structure that allows change,
- an implicit dimensionality that can later be counted.

The stage is loosened.  
It is not removed.

This book begins from a stricter position:

**If space is emergent, nothing spatial may be assumed at the start.**

Not abstractly.  
Not implicitly.  
Not "temporarily."

---

### 0.0.2 Why Background Independence Is Not Enough

Background independence removes *rigidity*.  
It does not remove *structure*.

A theory may allow geometry to evolve and still presume:

- that there is somewhere for evolution to occur,
- that relations presuppose adjacency,
- that differentiation presupposes extension.

These are not small assumptions.  
They are the question itself, answered prematurely.

To ask where space comes from while assuming spatial grammar is not an error of mathematics—it is an error of order.

This text refuses that order.

---

### 0.0.3 The Discipline of Starting Earlier

To begin before space requires restraint, not imagination.

We will impose the following condition at the outset:

**Nothing may be introduced whose definition depends on extension.**

This immediately forbids:

- coordinates
- distances
- directions
- motion
- points
- neighborhoods
- continuity defined by proximity

These are not postponed tools.  
They are disallowed primitives.

If any of them appear, they must appear as *consequences*.

---

### 0.0.4 What This Book Is (and Is Not)

This is not:

- a metaphorical philosophy of space,
- a speculative ontology,
- a reinterpretation of existing geometry,
- a new name for old structures.

This is:

- a constructive textbook,
- a rule-based ascent,
- a derivation of space from non-spatial constraints.

Every structure introduced will answer a necessity.  
Nothing will be introduced "because it feels natural."

Nature does not care what feels natural.

---

### 0.0.5 The Collapse Tension Substrate as the Starting Line

The framework used here begins not with space, time, matter, or fields, but with a pre-geometric domain called the **Collapse Tension Substrate (CTS)**.

CTS is not:

- empty space,
- a vacuum,
- an information space,
- a container.

CTS is a **permission structure**—a domain in which difference may arise without location.

At the start:

- nothing is somewhere,
- nothing moves,
- nothing is near or far.

And yet—not nothing.

---

### 0.0.6 Why a Textbook?

This material is written as a college-level textbook for a reason.

The goal is not persuasion.  
The goal is traceability.

Each chapter builds only on what has been earned.  
Each concept is introduced when it becomes unavoidable.

If the reader ever feels that space "should already be there," that feeling is the residue of habit—not a logical requirement.

This book is designed to remove that habit.

---

### 0.0.7 The Path Ahead

The structure of the book is intentional:

1. **CTS** — what exists before space
2. **Difference** — how asymmetry arises without geometry
3. **Direction** — how ordering appears without extension
4. **Memory** — how recursion loops without area
5. **Locking** — how stability emerges without volume
6. **Space** — not assumed, but forced into existence

Space will appear only when it cannot be avoided.

When it does, it will not arrive as a container—but as a consequence.

---

### 0.0.8 A Warning to the Reader

If you are looking for familiar landmarks, you will not find them early.

There are no axes to lean on.  
No diagrams to visualize.  
No coordinates to comfort you.

This discomfort is not a flaw.  
It is the signal that the question is finally being asked correctly.

---

**「問いが正しければ、空は遅れて現れる。」**  
*If the question is correct, space will arrive late.*
