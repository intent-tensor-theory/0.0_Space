## Rule of No Localization

Nothing may be assigned a position until position itself has emerged.

---

## Rule of No Implicit Dimensionality

No concept may carry hidden dimensional assumptions.

## Rule of Earned Structure

Every structure must arise from necessity, not convenience.

Metaphor is forbidden when it imports spatial intuition.

They must not appear until space has emerged.
