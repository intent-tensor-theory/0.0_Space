# 0.1 How to Read This Book

---

**「これは空間を使わない読書である。」**  
*This is reading without space.*

---

## What is meant by *pre-geometry*

Pre-geometry means: no geometric concepts are valid until they are earned.

This is not a stylistic choice. It is a methodological requirement.

---

## What will not be used (coordinates, metrics, manifolds)

The following tools are **forbidden** in this book until space emerges:

- Coordinates
- Metrics
- Manifolds
- Topology defined by neighborhoods
- Continuity defined by proximity

---

## What counts as a legitimate primitive

A legitimate primitive is:

- not defined in terms of extension
- not defined in terms of location
- operationally specified by rules

---

## How derivations will proceed without spatial intuition

Every derivation must:

1. State what is being assumed
2. Show what necessity forces the next step
3. Avoid smuggling in spatial concepts

If a step feels "natural," it is suspect.
