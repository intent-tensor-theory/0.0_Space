# 1.3 CTS as a Rule System

---

## CTS as constraint logic, not container

CTS is defined by what it permits and forbids, not by what it holds.

---

## Comparison to axiomatic systems

CTS resembles an axiomatic system:
- Start with primitives
- Build only what rules allow
- No hidden assumptions

---

## Why CTS is not ontological speculation

CTS is not a claim about "what exists."

It is a discipline for derivation.
