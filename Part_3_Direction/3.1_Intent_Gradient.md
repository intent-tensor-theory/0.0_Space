# 3.1 The Intent Gradient (∇Φ)

---

## Gradient without coordinates

∇Φ denotes ordered collapse tendency.

It has no x, y, z components.

---

## Gradient as asymmetry ordering

The gradient answers: which resolution tends to follow which?

---

## Why ∇Φ is not a vector yet

Vectors require a vector space.

A vector space requires dimension.

∇Φ has neither.
