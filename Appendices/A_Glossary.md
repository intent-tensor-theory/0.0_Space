# 付録A（Appendix A）
## Glossary of Pre-Geometric Terms
*(Locked Vocabulary — No Spatial Leakage)*

---

**「言葉が先に空を作る。だから、縛る。」**  
*Words create space before theory does. Therefore, we bind them.*

This appendix defines all technical terms used in the text **exactly as they are meant**, and **only as far as they are earned**.  
No definition here may rely on geometry unless explicitly marked *post-spatial*.

This glossary is **normative**, not descriptive.  
If a term is used differently elsewhere, *this book is not using it that way*.

## A.1 Foundational Terms (Pre-Spatial)

### Collapse Tension Substrate (CTS)

A pre-geometric permission domain in which difference may arise without location, extension, or containment.  
CTS is not space, not a field, and not a background.

---

### Permission

The capacity for a resolution to occur.  
Permission is not probability and not freedom; it is *logical admissibility*.

---

### Collapse

The rule-based selection of one admissible resolution from many **without invoking space or time**.  
Collapse is not motion, compression, or destruction.

---

### Tension

The coexistence of incompatible permissions within CTS.  
Tension is logical, not physical.

---

### Difference

Non-equivalence between collapse outcomes.  
Difference does not require distance, separation, or identity.

---

### Asymmetry

A persistent non-equivalence in collapse resolution.  
Asymmetry is the first generative condition.

---

## A.2 Process Terms (Pre-Geometric Structure)

### Direction

A consistent ordering of asymmetric collapse outcomes.  
Direction is order, not orientation.

---

### Ordering

A dependency relation between collapse events.  
Ordering implies *before/after* logically, not temporally.

---

### Intent Gradient (∇Φ)

*(Pre-Spatial Definition)*  
An operator denoting the tendency of collapse asymmetry to follow a consistent order.  
∇Φ is not a vector until space exists.

---

### Recursion

Repeated collapse where prior resolutions influence future admissibility.  
Recursion precedes memory, structure, and space.

---

## A.3 Memory Terms (Still Pre-Spatial)

### Loop

A recursive process that returns influence to its own prior condition.  
A loop is not a curve, circle, or enclosure.

---

### Memory

The influence of prior collapse history on present resolution.  
Memory is not storage and has no location.

---

### Phase

The contextual signature of a recursive return.  
Phase is not angle or rotation.

---

### Curl (∇×F)

*(Pre-Spatial Definition)*  
An operator denoting recursive self-reference.  
Curl is not rotation until geometry exists.

---

## A.4 Stability and Persistence

### Locking

Self-reinforcing recursive alignment that resists collapse drift.  
Locking does not imply rigidity or immobility.

---

### Curvature (∇²Φ)

*(Pre-Spatial Definition)*  
A measure of recursive self-consistency across memory loops.  
Curvature is not bending until space exists.

---

### Shell

A stabilized region of recursion sustained by locking.  
A shell is not an object, surface, or particle.

---

### Boundary

The exclusion of alternative collapse paths by locked recursion.  
Boundaries are logical before they are spatial.

---

## A.5 Spatial Terms (Post-Emergence Only)

⚠️ **The following terms are forbidden before Chapter 6.0 / 8.0**

---

### Space

The capacity for multiple persistent recursive structures to coexist without mutual exclusion.  
Space is a condition, not a substance.

---

### Region

A zone of recursive permission differentiated to allow coexistence.  
Regions precede coordinates.

---

### Distance

The remembered recursive cost required to maintain separation.  
Distance is not fundamental.

---

### Metric

A formalization of recursive separation cost.  
Metrics encode memory.

---

### Location

A label assigned to stabilized separation within space.  
Locations are bookkeeping devices.

---

### Point

A derived abstraction representing a limit of localization.  
Points are not primitive.

---

## A.6 What Is Explicitly Excluded

The following concepts **do not appear** in this book prior to space:

- manifold
- topology
- neighborhood
- continuity by proximity
- coordinate system
- frame of reference

If such terms appear, they are **post-emergent translations only**.

---

## A.7 Reading Rule for the Glossary

If a word feels "obvious," it is probably wrong.

Always refer back to this appendix when interpreting a term.  
The meanings here override intuition.

---

**「定義が守られれば、理論は壊れない。」**  
*When definitions are obeyed, the theory does not break.*
