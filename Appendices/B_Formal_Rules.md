# 付録B（Appendix B）
## Formal Rule Set of the Collapse Tension Substrate (CTS)
*(Axioms, Constraints, and Stop-Conditions)*

---

**「自由は最初に削られる。」**  
*Freedom is reduced first, so emergence can occur at all.*

This appendix states the **formal rules** governing the Collapse Tension Substrate.  
These are not interpretations.  
They are **constraints**.

If any rule is violated, space has been smuggled in and the construction fails.

---

## B.0 Purpose of the Rule Set

The CTS rule set exists to enforce one principle:

**Nothing spatial may appear unless it is forced by prior rules.**

These rules apply globally to Chapters 0.0–5.0 / 8.0  
They relax only after Chapter 6.0 / 8.0.

---

## B.1 Ontological Constraints (What May Exist)

### Rule B1.1 — No Extension

No entity, process, or state may possess length, area, volume, or shape.

---

### Rule B1.2 — No Location

Nothing may be defined as "somewhere."  
There are no positions, coordinates, or regions.

---

### Rule B1.3 — No Objects

CTS contains no particles, points, fields, or substances.  
Only permissions and resolutions exist.

---

### Rule B1.4 — No Implicit Geometry

Any construct that implies adjacency, proximity, orientation, or dimensionality is forbidden.

---

## B.2 Permissive Rules (What CTS Allows)

### Rule B2.1 — Permission Without Position

CTS may allow multiple admissible outcomes without placing them.

---

### Rule B2.2 — Difference Is Admissible

Non-equivalent outcomes are permitted without requiring separation.

---

### Rule B2.3 — Tension Is Logical

Mutually incompatible permissions may coexist without resolution.

---

### Rule B2.4 — Collapse Is Allowed

CTS permits resolution via selection without invoking space or time.

---

## B.3 Collapse Rules

### Rule B3.1 — Collapse Selects, It Does Not Move

Collapse is not a trajectory, flow, or transition through space.

---

### Rule B3.2 — Collapse Is Discrete

Each collapse yields a definite resolution, even if resolutions recur.

---

### Rule B3.3 — Collapse Has No Speed

No rate, velocity, or duration may be assigned.

---

### Rule B3.4 — Collapse May Repeat

Repeated collapse is permitted and is the root of recursion.

---

## B.4 Recursion Rules

### Rule B4.1 — Recursion Requires Prior Collapse

No recursive structure may exist without at least one collapse event.

---

### Rule B4.2 — Recursion Carries History

Past resolutions may influence future admissibility.

---

### Rule B4.3 — Recursion Does Not Imply Time

"Before" and "after" denote dependency, not temporal flow.

---

## B.5 Direction Rules (Chapter 3.0 Boundary)

### Rule B5.1 — Direction Is Ordering

Direction may exist only as consistent collapse ordering.

---

### Rule B5.2 — No Orientation

Direction must not be described using axes, angles, or vectors.

---

### Rule B5.3 — One Degree Only

Only a single ordering degree is allowed prior to memory.

---

## B.6 Memory Rules (Chapter 4.0 Boundary)

### Rule B6.1 — Memory Requires Return

No memory may exist without recursive looping.

---

### Rule B6.2 — Memory Is Influence, Not Storage

Nothing may "store" information in a place.

---

### Rule B6.3 — Phase Is Context

Phase may encode how recursion returns, not where.

---

## B.7 Locking Rules (Chapter 5.0 Boundary)

### Rule B7.1 — Locking Is Self-Reinforcement

Persistence must arise from recursion itself, not external constraint.

---

### Rule B7.2 — Locking Excludes Alternatives

A locked recursion forbids incompatible collapse paths.

---

### Rule B7.3 — Boundaries Are Logical

Boundaries exist as exclusion rules, not spatial surfaces.

---

## B.8 Space Admission Rule (Critical Threshold)

### Rule B8.1 — Space Is Forbidden Until Required

Space may not appear until coexistence of locked recursion demands it.

---

### Rule B8.2 — Space Is a Capacity

Space must be introduced as a permission for coexistence, not as a container.

---

### Rule B8.3 — Metrics Are Memory

Any notion of distance must arise from recursive cost, not extension.

---

## B.9 Forbidden Inference Rules

The following inferences are explicitly disallowed:

- imagining CTS as a void
- visualizing loops as shapes
- treating shells as objects
- assigning "inside/outside" prematurely
- importing mathematical spaces by analogy

Violation of these rules invalidates the derivation.

---

## B.10 Termination Rule

### Rule B10.1 — No Further Foundations

Once space emerges (Chapter 6.0 / 8.0), CTS rules no longer apply.

Further constructs (time, matter, observers) require **new rule sets**.

---

## B.11 Meta-Rule (Most Important)

**If a concept feels intuitive before Chapter 6.0, it is suspect.**

Intuition is trained on space.  
CTS precedes it.

---

**「制限は創造ではない。創造の条件である。」**  
*Constraint is not creation. It is the condition for creation.*
