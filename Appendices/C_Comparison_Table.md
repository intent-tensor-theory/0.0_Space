# 付録C（Appendix C）
## Classical Space vs Collapse-Derived Space
*(A Comparison Table of Assumptions vs Consequences)*

---

**「同じ言葉でも、始まりが違えば意味が違う。」**  
*The same word, begun too late, becomes something else.*

This appendix makes explicit what has been implicit throughout the book:  
**classical space and collapse-derived space are not the same concept**.

They share vocabulary.  
They do not share foundations.

This table is not rhetorical.  
It is diagnostic.

## C.1 Core Comparison Table

| Category | Classical / Standard Physics | Collapse-Derived Framework |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Status of Space** | Fundamental or assumed | Emergent consequence |
| **When Space Appears** | At the start | Chapter 6.0 / 8.0 only |
| **Role of Space** | Container for entities | Capacity for coexistence |
| **Ontological Priority** | Space → objects | Locked recursion → space |
| **Empty Space** | Possible and meaningful | Unused recursive permission |
| **Vacuum** | Physical state of space | Post-spatial phenomenon |

## C.2 Geometry and Structure

| Category | Classical View | Collapse-Derived View |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Geometry** | Fundamental scaffold | Memory of recursion |
| **Metric** | Primitive structure | Recorded separation cost |
| **Distance** | Length between points | Recursive differentiation count |
| **Dimension** | Given (e.g. 3D) | Emerges from degrees of recursion |
| **Curvature** | Bending of spacetime | Locked recursive self-consistency |
| **Topology** | Presupposed | Derived or inapplicable pre-space |

## C.3 Points, Locations, and Objects

| Category | Classical View | Collapse-Derived View |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Point** | Primitive element | Derived abstraction |
| **Location** | Fundamental label | Late bookkeeping device |
| **Object** | Occupies space | Stabilized recursive shell |
| **Boundary** | Spatial surface | Logical exclusion rule |
| **Inside / Outside** | Spatial distinction | Emerges after locking |

---

## C.4 Motion, Change, and Time

| Category | Classical View | Collapse-Derived View |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Motion** | Change of position | Post-spatial description |
| **Velocity** | Fundamental quantity | Derived from recursive update |
| **Time** | Independent parameter | Emerges from phase drift (deferred) |
| **Dynamics** | Evolution in space | Recursion before space |
| **Causality** | Temporal ordering | Dependency ordering |

---

## C.5 Fields and Forces

| Category | Classical View | Collapse-Derived View |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Fields** | Exist in space | Generate space |
| **Forces** | Act across distance | Effects of recursive persistence |
| **Gravity** | Curvature causes motion | Locked recursion alters coexistence |
| **Nonlocality** | Paradoxical | Natural (pre-spatial coherence) |

---

## C.6 Quantum Interpretation

| Category | Classical / QM View | Collapse-Derived View |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Wavefunction** | Spatial amplitude | Pre-spatial recursion descriptor |
| **Superposition** | Multiple spatial states | Unlocked recursive permission |
| **Measurement** | Observer interaction | Forced recursive locking |
| **Collapse** | Mysterious | Stabilization event |
| **Entanglement** | Nonlocal effect | Pre-spatial linkage surviving space |

---

## C.7 Cosmology

| Category | Classical View | Collapse-Derived View |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Big Bang** | Explosion in space | Transition from pre-space |
| **Expansion** | Space stretching | Increasing coexistence capacity |
| **Singularity** | Point of infinite density | Breakdown of spatial description |
| **Horizon** | Geometric boundary | Recursive permission limit |

---

## C.8 Methodological Difference (Most Important)

| Aspect | Classical Approach | CTS Approach |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Starting Assumption** | Space exists | Space forbidden |
| **Use of Geometry** | Immediate | Delayed and earned |
| **Role of Intuition** | Trusted | Suspended |
| **Failure Mode** | Hidden assumptions | Explicit constraint violation |
| **Stopping Condition** | Open-ended | Closed ascent |

---

## C.9 Diagnostic Test (Reader Use)

A simple test now exists:

**If a theory requires space to explain space,**  
**it is not foundational.**

This book passes that test by construction.

---

## C.10 Final Clarification

Collapse-derived space does not *replace* classical space.

It explains **why classical space works when it does**.

Classical physics begins **after** space has stabilized.  
This framework explains **how that stabilization occurs**.

There is no contradiction—only hierarchy.

**「遅れて始まる理論は、基礎ではない。」**  
*A theory that begins late cannot be fundamental.*
