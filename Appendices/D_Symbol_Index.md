# 付録D（Appendix D）
## Symbol Index and Operator Reference
*(Canonical Glyph Set — No Hidden Geometry)*

**「記号は意味を短縮する。だから、厳密でなければならない。」**  
*Symbols compress meaning. Therefore they must be exact.*

This appendix is the **authoritative reference** for every symbol used in the text.  
Each symbol is defined **only at the stage where it is earned**.

If a symbol appears to imply space before Chapter 6.0 / 8.0, it is being misread.

## D.7 Spatial Symbols (Post-Emergence Only)

⚠️ **Forbidden prior to Chapter 6.0 / 8.0**

---

### x, y, z — Spatial Coordinates

**Stage:** Chapter 6.0 / 8.0  
**Meaning:**  
Labels for stabilized separation within emergent space.  
Not fundamental.

---

### d(·,·) — Distance Metric

**Stage:** Chapter 6.0 / 8.0

Tracks recursive update order after space exists.  
Time is not fundamental here.

### Δᵢ — Recursive Domain Gate

**Stage:** Post-Space (Appendix Use)  
**Meaning:**  
Operator-defined recursion domains, not spatial planes.

---

## D.10 Reading Rule (Final)

If a symbol seems to "mean more" than its definition here,  
that extra meaning came from intuition—not from the text.

This appendix overrides all intuition.
