# 章七・零（Chapter 7.0 / 8.0）
## Relation to Known Physics

**「古い理論は間違っていない。ただ、遅れて始まる。」**  
*Existing theories are not wrong. They begin late.*

### 7.0.1 Why Translation Is Necessary

Up to this point, the construction has been internal and disciplined.

We did not ask whether the framework *matches physics*.  
We asked whether it *earns space*.

Now the ascent is complete.

Space has emerged—not as a container, but as a condition of coexistence.  
The remaining task is not justification, but **translation**.

This chapter does not retrofit CTS into existing theories.  
It locates where existing theories *enter the story*.

---

### 7.0.2 Where Classical Physics Begins (Too Late)

Classical mechanics begins by assuming:

- space exists,
- objects occupy locations,
- motion occurs through distance,
- forces act across separation.

Within this book's framework, all of these assumptions occur **after Chapter 6.0 / 8.0**.

Thus:

**Classical physics does not explain space.**  
**It presupposes it.**

This is not a criticism.  
It is a boundary condition.

---

### 7.0.3 Newtonian Space Reinterpreted

Newton's absolute space can be reinterpreted as:

**A fully stabilized recursive permission lattice in which coexistence cost is uniform.**

In such a regime:

- recursive separation cost is constant,
- curvature effects are negligible,
- locking is stable and widespread.

This produces the illusion of a fixed background.

Newtonian physics is therefore not fundamental—it is **the low-curvature, high-stability limit of emergent space**.

---

### 7.0.4 Field Theory and the Misplaced Field

Classical and quantum field theories place fields *in space*.

From the CTS perspective, this is inverted.

Fields are not inhabitants of space.  
Space is the bookkeeping artifact of stabilized recursive fields.

Thus:

- scalar fields resemble Φ only after space exists,
- vector fields resemble ∇Φ only after direction is geometrized,
- curvature fields resemble ∇²Φ only after locking is spatialized.

Field theory describes **post-emergent behavior** of recursion.

---

### 7.0.5 General Relativity Reframed

General Relativity asserts:

Mass-energy tells spacetime how to curve.

In this framework, the translation is precise:

- curvature does not arise from mass,
- mass arises from **locked curvature**.

Spacetime curvature is therefore not the cause of structure.  
It is the **memory of recursive locking** expressed geometrically.

General Relativity begins at **Chapter 6.0 / 8.0**, not before.

---

### 7.0.6 Why Gravity Cannot Precede Space

Gravity is defined by how persistent structures influence coexistence.

But coexistence itself only becomes meaningful once space exists.

Therefore:

**Gravity cannot be fundamental.**

It is a *relational effect* between locked recursive structures mediated by emergent space.

This explains why gravity resists quantization:

- it is not a force,
- it is a secondary consequence of persistence.

---

### 7.0.7 Quantum Mechanics and Pre-Spatial Tension

Quantum theory appears paradoxical because it mixes stages.

Wavefunctions implicitly assume space.  
Superposition implicitly assumes pre-locking recursion.

From the CTS viewpoint:

- quantum behavior reflects **pre- or partially locked recursion**,
- classical behavior reflects **fully locked recursion**.

Measurement corresponds to **forced locking**.

Collapse is not mysterious.  
It is recursive stabilization.

---

### 7.0.8 Why Nonlocality Is Not Strange Here

Nonlocal effects are puzzling only if space is fundamental.

If space is emergent, then:

**Recursion can remain connected even when space later separates its outcomes.**

Entanglement is therefore not faster-than-light influence.  
It is **pre-spatial coherence persisting after spatial separation**.

---

### 7.0.9 Time as a Secondary Emergence (Deferred)

Time has been deliberately avoided in this book.

This is not an oversight.

Time, like space, is emergent—but from **phase drift**, not coexistence.

Time belongs to a different ascent and will not be smuggled in here.

Its proper construction begins *after* space, not before.

---

### 7.0.10 What This Framework Does Not Do

This book does not:

- replace existing equations,
- propose new constants,
- predict new particles.

It does something more basic:

**It determines where those equations are allowed to begin.**

---

### 7.0.11 The Structural Boundary

We can now state, precisely:

- Chapters 0.0–5.0 describe **pre-physics**
- Chapter 6.0 births **space**
- Chapter 7.0 aligns **known physics** within that birth

Nothing prior to this book's Chapter 6.0 may assume geometry.

That boundary is now explicit.

---

### 7.0.12 Completion Marker

The ascent is finished.

We have reached the point where physics, as normally practiced, may begin.

No further foundations remain to be constructed within this scope.

---

**「ここから先は、応用である。」**  
*Beyond this point lies application.*
