# 章六・零（Chapter 6.0 / 8.0）
## The Birth of Space

---

**「空間は容れ物ではない。共存の条件である。」**  
*Space is not a container. It is the condition for coexistence.*

---

### 6.0.1 Why Space Can No Longer Be Avoided

Up to this point, every concept has been introduced reluctantly—only when forced.

Now, avoidance fails.

At 5.0 / 8.0, recursion locked.  
Persistence appeared.  
Shells emerged as self-sustaining recursive structures.

The moment **more than one** such structure exists, a contradiction arises:

**Two persistent structures cannot occupy the same recursive condition simultaneously.**

This is not a spatial statement.  
It is a logical one.

To resolve this contradiction, a new capacity must appear.

That capacity is **space**.

---

### 6.0.2 What Space Is Not (Final Rejection)

Before defining space positively, we must permanently discard inherited meanings.

Space is **not**:

- a background,
- a void,
- an empty container,
- a pre-existing grid,
- an arena in which things happen.

All of these assume what must now be explained.

---

### 6.0.3 The Minimal Definition of Space

In this framework, space is defined as:

**The capacity for multiple persistent recursive structures to coexist without mutual exclusion.**

Nothing more.  
Nothing less.

Space is not substance.  
It is **permission**.

---

### 6.0.4 Why Locking Demands Separation

A locked shell excludes alternative collapse paths.

If two shells shared identical recursive conditions, one would suppress the other.

Thus, coexistence requires differentiation **beyond recursion state alone**.

This differentiation is not:

- memory,
- direction,
- curvature.

It is **separability**.

Space is the mechanism by which separability is achieved.

---

### 6.0.5 Space as Emergent Capacity, Not Entity

Space does not appear as an object.

It appears as a **capacity** that recursion did not previously require.

That capacity is:

**The ability to index persistence without conflict.**

Indexing here does not mean coordinates yet.  
It means *non-interference*.

Space allows shells to exist *apart* without defining where "apart" is.

---

### 6.0.6 The First Spatial Distinction: Here vs Not-Here

The earliest spatial distinction is not distance.

It is:

**Compatibility vs incompatibility.**

A shell occupies a region of recursive permission.  
Another shell must occupy a *different* region.

"Region" is now meaningful—but only as **exclusion zones in recursion**.

This is proto-space.

---

### 6.0.7 Metric Emerges as Memory

Once coexistence is possible, something subtle happens.

The effort required to maintain separation becomes relevant.

That effort is counted—not in length, but in **recursive cost**.

From this, distance emerges.

**Distance is remembered separation.**

Metrics are therefore not fundamental.

They are records of how much recursive differentiation was required to avoid collapse interference.

---

### 6.0.8 Why Space Appears Fully Only After 3D Locking

Recall the stages:

- 1D: ordered progression
- 2D: recursive return
- 3D: reinforcement and locking

Only at 3D does persistence become strong enough to demand coexistence.

Therefore:

**Space does not exist in 0D, 1D, or 2D.**  
**It becomes unavoidable only after recursive locking.**

CTS is pre-spatial.  
Locking is pre-spatial.  
Space is **post-locking**.

---

### 6.0.9 The Illusion of "Empty Space"

Once space exists, regions without shells are interpreted as empty.

This is an illusion.

Such regions are not "nothing."  
They are **unused recursive permission**.

Space is never empty.  
It is merely unoccupied by locked recursion.

---

### 6.0.10 Localization as a Late Invention

Only now does the idea of *location* become meaningful.

Location is not fundamental.

It is:

**A label assigned to stable separation within recursive permission space.**

Points are not primitive.  
They are bookkeeping devices.

---

### 6.0.11 What Has Finally Appeared

At this stage, we can say—without metaphor:

- Space exists ✔
- But only as emergent capacity
- Not as background
- Not as substance

Space is the shadow cast by persistence.

---

### 6.0.12 Transition Marker

We now have:

- Difference ✔
- Direction ✔
- Memory ✔
- Locking ✔
- Space ✔

The ascent is complete.

What remains is interpretation.

---

**「空は結果であって、原因ではない。」**  
*Space is an effect, not a cause.*
